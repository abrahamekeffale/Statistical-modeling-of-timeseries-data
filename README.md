# Brent Oil Price Analysis Dashboard

This project is designed to analyze and visualize how various events affect Brent oil prices over time. It includes time series analysis, a forecasting model, and an interactive dashboard built using Flask (backend) and React (frontend). The dashboard allows users to explore historical trends, forecasts, and correlations with significant events, providing insights for stakeholders.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- Ingest historical Brent oil prices and event data (e.g., political decisions, conflicts, sanctions).
- Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and converting date columns into datetime format.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on trends in oil prices over time.
- **Goal**: Understand the distribution and patterns of Brent oil prices.

### Task 2: Building a Forecasting Model
- Train a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to forecast future Brent oil prices.
- Perform statistical checks (e.g., stationarity, autocorrelation) and use techniques like differencing if necessary.
- Tune the model using metrics like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAE.
- **Goal**: Create a reliable forecasting model to predict future oil prices based on past data.

### Task 3: Developing an Interactive Dashboard for Data Analysis Results
- Build a dashboard using Flask and React to visualize the analysis results interactively.
- Include features to help stakeholders explore how various events affect Brent oil prices, with tools like Recharts or D3.js for charts.
- Key components:
  - **Backend (Flask)**: Serves APIs for analysis data, model outputs, and performance metrics.
  - **Frontend (React)**: Provides an intuitive user interface to display trends, forecasts, and event correlations.
  - **Features**: Filters, date ranges, and event highlights for interactive data exploration.

## Features

- **Historical Trends**: Display historical Brent oil prices with interactive charts.
- **Forecasting and Model Accuracy**: Visualize forecasted prices and display metrics such as RMSE, MAE.
- **Event Highlights**: Highlight specific events that caused price spikes or drops, allowing users to explore their impact.
- **Data Filtering**: Users can filter data by date range and drill down into specific events for deeper insights.
- **Responsive Design**: Dashboard is responsive and accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Requirements

### Backend

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas
- statsmodels (for the VAR model)

### Frontend

- Node.js
- React
- Axios (for API requests)
- Recharts or React Chart.js 2 (for charts)

## Installation and Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The backend will start at http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required npm packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will start at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
After both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You can interact with the dashboard to explore Brent oil price trends, forecast future prices, and examine significant events that influenced price changes.

API Endpoints
The Flask backend provides the following API endpoints for the React frontend:

/api/historical_data: Returns historical Brent oil price data.
/api/model_results: Returns forecasted prices based on the VAR model.
/api/metrics: Returns model evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
/api/events: Returns a list of significant events and their dates.
These endpoints allow the frontend to fetch data for display and analysis.

Key Libraries
Flask: Lightweight web framework for building the API.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
statsmodels: For time series modeling (VAR) and statistical analysis.
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.
Recharts / React Chart.js 2: For creating responsive and interactive charts in React.
Customization
Add Data: Place additional data files in the backend/data folder, and update app.py to load them if necessary.
Add Components: You can create more React components in the frontend/src/components folder to enhance dashboard functionality.
Future Enhancements
Real-time Data: Integrate real-time oil price data if an API is available.
Authentication: Implement user authentication for data access control.
Export Features: Enable data export options, allowing users to save visualizations as CSV or images.
Advanced Filters: Add more filtering options based on various criteria (e.g., region, oil type).
